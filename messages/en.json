Unlike simple cutter marks, which indicate where to cut, cutter registration marks are read by sensors on automated cutting, slitting, or finishing machines to ensure each cut is accurately positioned relative to the printed content. These marks help compensate for slight shifts in sheet position, stretch, or skew during printing or feeding. They're essential in high-speed, automated workflows—especially in digital finishing systems—to maintain consistent output quality and prevent cutting errors.",
